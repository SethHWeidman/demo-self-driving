# Streamlit Self-Driving Car Demo

## Description
This is a demo of the YOLO real-time object detection model with Streamlit on the Udacity self-driving-car dataset.

The demo consists of an app built with Streamlit. The app runs the YOLO model
on images from the Udacity dataset in real time. The demo allows the user to select an image. It shows
a reference 'ground image' for the detected objects and an image with the objects detected by YOLO.
